# 16-32-bit-Custom-CPU
This project has mainly been hardware related for the last five years, but software is needed to test and actually use the CPU.

I will be building a language reference, followed by an assembler, and then a disassembler. Eventually, I want to add Lisp and/or FORTH compilers. The end goal is an interactive 1970s style TTL computer running interactive Lisp and capable of executing stored programs.
